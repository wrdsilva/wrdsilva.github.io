Hello, visitor!

My name is Washington Rodrigo Dias da Silva, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Federal University of S達o Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. My research focuses on Deep Learning applications and Distributed Computing within Computer Networks. Currently, I work at the [Laboratory of Studies in Networks, Innovation, and, Software (LERIS)](https://leris.dcomp.ufscar.br/) at the Sorocaba Campus. I am also a part of the [SMART NEtworks and ServiceS for 2030 (SMARTNESS) Engineering Research Center](https://smartness2030.tech/), where I contribute as a PhD student within the [Distributed Computer Networking (DisCoNet) research strand](https://smartness2030.tech/research_strands/disconet-distributed-computer-networking/). 

My research interests are diverse and include Artificial Intelligence and its applications, with a current focus on Image Processing and Analysis, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Distributed Computing.

If you have any questions about my publications or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to reach out.
